# Letter_Project_CESC
The objective of the " Online Feedback Letter For Inspection/Exchange Done By Testing Department " project is to create a web application that dynamically generates consumer feedback letters based on consumer and docket numbers. The system retrieves relevant consumer data from a database and populates a pre-designed letter template in real-time.
